CheckForDigits: This program checks if a given string contains only digits. It uses recursion to check each character in the string and returns true if all characters are digits, otherwise false.

Factorial: This program calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion. It takes an input from the user and recursively calculates the factorial of the input number.

Fibonacci: This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. It takes an input from the user and recursively calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

IsPrime: This program checks if a given integer is a prime number using recursion. It takes an input from the user and recursively checks if the input number is a prime number.

MinArray: This program finds the minimum element in an array of integers using recursion. It takes an input from the user for the size of the array and the elements of the array, and recursively finds the minimum element in the array.

PowerOf: This program calculates the power of a given base raised to a given exponent using recursion. It takes inputs for the base and exponent from the user and recursively calculates the power.

ReversedArr: This program reverses an array of integers using recursion. It reverses the array in-place using a helper function that uses recursion to swap elements in the array.

GCD: This program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given integers using recursion. It takes inputs for two integers from the user and recursively calculates their GCD.

BinomialCoefficient: This program calculates the binomial coefficient of two given integers using recursion. It takes inputs for two integers from the user and recursively calculates their binomial coefficient.

DecimalToBinary: This program converts a decimal number to its binary representation using recursion. It takes an input for a decimal number from the user and recursively converts it to binary.
